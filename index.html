        <h2 name ="Monclova">Monclova, Coauhila, Mexico</h2>
        <p>The place where I was born. I lived here until I was seven, which is when my mother emmigrated to the USA. I was able to join her shorty aftewards. My grandparente still live here and I visit them every two years or so. The nearest airport is Monterrey, 
            which makes getting there somewhat difficult. Regardless, I enjoy spending time with them. <img src="https://programadestinosmexico.com/que-ver/destinos-mexico/monclova/Parroquia%20de%20Santiago%20Ap%C3%B3stol%20.jpg" alt="Monclova"></p>
        
        <h2 name="Dallas">Dallas, Texas, USA</h2>
        <p>I lived here only shorty. This was the first place my family settled. I don't visit Texas very often, other than when flying out of the Houston airport headed towards Mexico :) </p>
    
        <h2>Moore, Oklahoma, USA </h2>
        <p>I spend quite a bit of time in OKlahoma. My uncle settled down in Oklahoma City and runs his small business there. I visit at least once a year to see him, usually during Christmas or Thanksgiving.</p>
        
        <h2>Overland Park, Kansas, USA</h2>
        <p> This is the place I call home, as its the place I spend most of my childhood. I graduated from Shawnee Mission West High School and moved back after graduating from college.</p>
        
        <h2>Manhattan Kansas, USA</h2>
        <p>I lived here for only two years while I went to college. I greatly enjoyed living here, as its a very walkable and bike friendly place. I have fond memories of walking to class or biking if I was running late. I wish I would have spend more time here as I 
            left shorty after graduating.
